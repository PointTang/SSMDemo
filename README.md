Recently I need to be a web developer. But I haven't learn before.

First of all, I found our web project based on "maven + spring + springmvc + mybatis".
Then I study them begin with spring and maven.

Modules:
1. <a href="https://github.com/PointTang/SSMDemo/blob/master/README/spring1st.md">spring1st</a>. I copy it from a primary teaching book, only to learn what a project with spring should be.   
2. <a href="https://github.com/PointTang/SSMDemo/blob/master/README/spring2nd.md">spring2nd</a>. Copied form the same book, learned a little skill than 1st.
3. When I run spring2nd successfully, I turn my eyes to a ssm demo wrote by my master. You can see it at <a href="https://github.com/1181631922/SpringMybatisDemo">SpringMybatisDemo</a>. Hm, that demo has lack *.sql . And I found the tables' name in his code. Then I run his demo succesfully.
4. <a href="https://github.com/PointTang/SSMDemo/blob/master/README/springrest.md">springrest</a>. Then I found that if I always learning the book, I can't get what I want to know directly. Then I began to found someting from internet. This demo used maven to make a web service of restful style. Learn from <http://www.cnblogs.com/tzyy/p/4837701.html>.
5. <a href="https://github.com/PointTang/SSMDemo/blob/master/README/springmvc1st.md">springmvc1st</a>. Then I make a springmvc demo with maven.
6. <a href="https://github.com/PointTang/SSMDemo/blob/master/README/mybatis1st.md">mybabtis1st</a>. A mybatis demo with maven. I have tried to make a springmvc+mybatis demo before but failed. Then I realized that I should know how mybatis works firstly. So this module be made.  


To be continued.
