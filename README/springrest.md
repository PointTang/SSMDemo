springrest

A restful web service with maven + spring.

When run successfully, you can use <localhost:8080/greeting> , <localhost:8080/greeting2>, <localhost:8080/greeting3>, <localhost:8080/greeting4/abc> to show something.

In this module, I tested how to get params from a restful url. And I think it will be useful for my future learning.
 
Next step, I'll learn what is springmvc.
